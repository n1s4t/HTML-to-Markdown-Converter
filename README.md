## ü§î Why This Converter Stands Out

This isn\'t just another format switcher. It\'s a complete workflow tool
designed for developers, writers, and content managers who frequently
work with both HTML and Markdown.

-   **All-in-One Workspace:** No more switching between tabs for
    > converting and previewing. The three-panel layout shows your
    > source, your output, and the final rendered result in one unified
    > view.

-   **Bi-Directional Power:** Effortlessly switch from being an HTML -\>
    > Markdown converter to a Markdown -\> HTML converter with a single
    > click.

-   **100% Client-Side Privacy:** All conversions happen directly in
    > your browser. Your data is never sent to a server, ensuring
    > complete privacy and offline usability.
